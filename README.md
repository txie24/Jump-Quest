Jump Quest is a challenging platformer game inspired by the mechanics of "Jump King." The
player controls a character who must ascend through various levels by making precise jumps.
The main objective is to reach the top, overcoming various obstacles and hazards along the
way. The game emphasizes skill, timing, and patience, as the character can fall back down to
lower levels if jumps are mistimed.
